Version:  2.2

Description:  The routines in this file are broken into two groups.  Those
		      routines which are meant to be the interface to this database
		      library named "dbV2_xxxxxx",  and routines named "dbuV2_xxxxxxx"
		      which are meant to be only used internally.

		Interface to the db library routines:

		dbV2_Open() - start up a session and open or create db file
		dbV2_close() - close down session, close db file, free up mem
		dbV2_StoreItem() - insert/replace an item to db file
		dbV2_GetEntry() - retrieve a database entry
		dbV2_GetFirstKid() - get keying identifier for first entry in db
           file
		dbV2_GetNextKid() - get a following key identifier (for stepping)
		dbV2_Compact() - compacts the free space in the db file
		dbV2_Info() - retrieve info about the session's db file

		The routines in this file are not meant for general
		use.

/* 
 * Version 2.01 Data Base structures:
 */

/* In order to track free space in the database file, we keep a table of
 * available blocks in memory.  This table is stored in the database
 * header, and therefore also stored to disk when the db file header
 * is written out.  As the number of free/available blocks increases,
 * the table expands to fill the "tail" space of the file header block.
 * If we reach the point where the table would be too large to fit, we
 * split the table in half. One half is kept "active", while the other
 * half is pushed onto an availability stack ( written out to
 * the database file in a block other than the header).  The table that
 * sees the most use will be the one currently used and stored in the
 * header. As blocks are used up, the currently used table will then
 * have less blocks marked as free.  When it reaches the point of being
 * all used up (no more marked as available) the availability stack
 * will be "popped", reading it in from the db file, and that table will
 * become the current table (and thus stored in the header of the db file).
 *
 * The availability table is set up in the following manner. Each block
 * that is marked as free in the db file is represented in a structure
 * "avail_elem", which has the size of the available block and also
 * the offset in the file to that free block.  The table itself is defined
 * by a structure "avail_block" which contains info on how many elements
 * will fit into it, how many elements are currently in the table, a file
 * offset (from start) as to where the next table is , and the
 * actual array of "avail_elem" items.

 * the kid itself, which is used when we are searching for kid matches
 * without having to read each kid in from the file... (searching is done
 * using the hash, and secondarily short kid, then if we find a possible
 * match, the kid is fully compared against the entry. This means we
 * don't have to read in the full entry if it wasn't cached, and also
 * speeds up the comparisons)
 *
 * To track all the stored elements, a "storage_table" is used.  This
 * structure contains an array of the storage element structures,
 * a count of how many "used" elements we have in the table, an array
 *  of available elements (for filling in a file block), a count
 *  of how many are available in the current file storage block
 * (see the preceeding available description on how this works),
 * and the number of bits that are used from the kid hash for these
 * storage elements in the directory/index array.
 * To speed up writes to the db file, we allocate file blocks with a
 * certain number of available slots open, otherwise we could possibly
 * be allocating more space to the file each time. (depends on the
 * availability of previously deleted elements - the availability
 * table in the header....)
 *
 * When the storage block/table gets full, we go through the same
 * split as described in the availability table description.
 *
 * The contents are split between them by the use of the first few bits
 * of the 31 bit hash function.  The location in a block is the hash
 * value modulo the size of the block.

General Database Routines
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

db_Open()

short db_Open(ulong *db_session, char *filepath, char *filename, long access,
long blocksize)

This routine is used to start up a session with the database manager. The
caller will either provide a pre-existing database filename & path or
the name & path to be used for a new database file.  The access parameter is used
to indicate what type of access to the database file the caller wants. The
blocksize parameter is used when creating a new database file to configure
the sized blocks that are allcoated by the db mgr when extending the file. If the
file already exists, then this field will be ignored.

If an error occurs, no new session will be created, and an appropriate
error code will be returned.

parameters
	db_session (in/out) = ptr to storage for session parameter for a newly
		created session with the db manager. Once the session is connected
		to a particular file, all operations with that file must be accompanied
		by the session parameter. (all future calls to the db manager).
		(caller provides storage for a ulong, which will be filled in by this
		routine if everything goes well).

	filepath (input) = the path to an existing db file, or path where a new
		db file will be created (path does not include the filename itself).
		The path must have an ending "/" or ":" or whatever it is that
		your particular file system uses.  (null terminated C string)

	filename (input) = the filename of an existing db file, or name for a new
		db file. (null terminated C string)

	access (input) = access type flags {DB_READ, DB_WRITE, DB_RDWR, DB_NEW}
		DB_READ - open an existing db file for read only access.

		DB_WRITE - open an existing db file for write only access.

		DB_RDWR - open an existing db file for read and write access.

		DB_NEW - If file doesn't exist, create new.  If file already
			exists, report error. (New opened with read and write access.)

	blocksize (input) = the db file is created in multiple chunks of size
		"blocksize" bytes.  Depending on the type of data being stored, this
		value can be tailored to best serve the situation.  If this value is
		less than the default value, then the blocksize will be set to the
		default value DB_BLOCK_SIZE.  If the file already exists, this field
		is ignored.

returns:
	one of the following error codes will be returned

	DB_NO_ERR			- everything fine
	DB_BAD_PARAM		- bad parameter passed to this routine
	DB_EXISTS			- file already exists (can't create new )
	db_Open_ERR			- named db file not found
	DB_READ_ERR			- file read i/o error
	DB_WRITE_ERR		- file write i/o error
	DB_NOT_DB_FILE		- given file is not a database file
	DB_SEEK_ERR			- file seek error (locating dir/storage table )
	DB_NO_MEM			- out of memory
	DB_DATABASE_EMPTY	- when open for read only, and no data exists yet


General Notes:
	It is forseen that in our particular case, we don't have to worry about
	more than one program trying to access the same file - otherwise
	synchronization problems would crop up....the session info would have
	to be tracked differently than is done here.

by this routine.

parameters:

returns:
	one of the following error codes will be returned

	DB_NO_ERR		 - everything fine
	DB_BAD_PARAM	- bad parameter passed to this routine

General Notes:
	The session id will no longer be valid, so if passed in any calls to
	the db mgr after closing, will be reported as a non-existing session.

dbV2_GetNextKid()

short dbV2_GetNextKid(ulong db_session, DB_Kid *kid, DB_Kid **next_kid)

This routine is used to "walk" through the entries in the database.  Calling
dbV2_GetFirstKid() will return keying information for the first entry, and
then the caller would use dbV2_GetNextKid() to access each suceeding entry
in the database.  The caller get's their own copy of the keying identifier
data, so once they no longer need the kid, they should free up the data and
the kid structure.

NOTE: If the caller wanted the actual data associated with any of the keys
returned, they would then have to make a call to dbV2_GetEntry() using the kid
returned from their call.


Paramters:
	db_session (input) = the session parameter that was returned
		 from a call to db_Open().

	kid (input) = the keying identifier for the entry in the
		database that is the precursor to the one you want.

	next_kid (input/output) = ptr storage for the keying identifier for
		the next entry in the database If there is no next entry, then
		next_kid will be set to NULL, and the error flag will be
		DB_NOT_FOUND.


returns:

	DB_NO_ERR		 - everything fine
	DB_BAD_PARAM	- bad parameter passed to this routine
	DB_NOT_FOUND	- no entry for given key info found in database

	elem_loc (input) = the currently addressd element for which the caller
		wants the following elements kid.

	return_kid	(input) = ptr to kid structure which will be filled in
		with the kids length and data upon success.


returns:
	one of the following error codes will be returned

	DB_NO_ERR		 - This routine indicates sucess thru it's setting
		the fields of "return_kid".  If "return_kid" is not filled in, then
		the next element was not available, but this is still considered
		to be DB_NO_ERR since it's not fatal.

	if other than not found happens (bad errors) the appropriate error
	codes will be returned.

	DB_NO_MEM			 - out of memory

	other codes may be returned by subroutines.

static void dbuV2_free (DB_Session_StructV2 *session,long file_adr,long num_bytes)

This low level routine is used to free up space of size num_bytes in the
sessions database file, starting at file offset "file_adr".  The space
freed is recorded into the availability table so that it can be re-used

of the current storage table, the space may be put into either the
current storage tables avail table or the file headers avail table. If
the space is larger than a file block size, the we will add it to the
files header avail table. If smaller than a full file block size, we will
attempt to add it to the current storage tables avail table (if it's
not already maxed out on avail entries).

Parameters:

This low level routine is used to retrieve an avail element (free space)

an element is found the meets the size requirement, the the table is
adjusted so that the other elements are shifted,  the av_count will be
decremented and the caller gets the element for their use.  If no
element is found, then the returned element will have a zero size and
zero file offset.  No file i/o is done by this routine, it only works
with the avail elements in the table that the caller has provided.


Parameters:

	size (input) = size in bytes that an element is requested to
		be of greater size

	av_table (input) = the table that an avail element is to
		searched for, and used if found

	av_count (input/output) = how many elements are in the
		avail table.  Modified if one is found.

returns:
	Upon sucess, the return element will have the file offset and

	entries which meet the size requirement, then the returned
	element will have a file offset of zero, and a size of zero.

cache table will be made large enought to hold "size" number of
cached elements. In the case where the cache for the indicated
session already exists, this routine will just return, but not
indicate any error.


Parameters:

dbuV2_hash()

static long dbuV2_hash (DB_Kid kid)

This low level routine is used to run the hash function over the
given keying identifier's data.  The routine calculates a 31 bit
hash value, which is used as an index into the directory index
by using the top "n" dir bits.  This hash is also used to figure
out where in a storage block the element resides by taking the
value modulo the storage table size.



Parameters:

	kid (input) = the keying identifier whose data is to be
		hashed (the keying data itself, not the entry data)


returns:
	The 31 bit hash value.


NOTES:  for an in-depth description on the use of hashing for directory
		table use, see:
		Extendible hashing -- a fast access method for dynamic files.

dbuV2_findkey()

static long dbuV2_findkey (DB_Session_StructV2 *session,DB_Kid *kid,char

This low level routine is called upon to locate an entry in the database file
with the given kid.  If a match is found, the storage table for that block is
loaded (if not already cached), and then we insure that the entry for the kid
is also in the cache.  When returning to the caller, we provide the storage
element location of the requested item (or -1 if not found), and fill in the
kid/data pair ptr (dptr) for the caller.  The calculated hash is also returned
since we use it when adding items, and we check first to see if an item
exists using this routine.

Parameters:

	session (input) = the session parameter that was returned from a
		call to db_Open().

	kid (input) = keying identifier info we are to match upon

	dptr (input/output) = upon a match, this pointer storage will be
filled
		in with the memory location of the entries key&data.

	new_hash_val (output) = the calculated hash value for the keying
		identifier is returned to the caller.

returns:
